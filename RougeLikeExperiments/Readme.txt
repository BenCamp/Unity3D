Beelzabee's Readme :)

Right now I'm just trying to experiment with the concepts of game design.
Most of the ways I'm doing things here (especially logic errors) are not how I would do them normally.
If they work out.. sure why not.
I've started on the openning of the program to experiment with these callbacks/events.
If they work out I'll use them as a basis for the game itself.
Otherwise woop! Garbage they go.

I'll expand this readme as I go along.
