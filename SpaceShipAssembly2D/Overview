I've changed my mind on a few things with this project now that I've had gone through tutorials and done some experimenting. 

 - I'm trying to use gameobjects as little as possible. 
 - I want to break the game logic from the graphics.
 - I'll use polygon colliders.
 
 The biggest problem I can think of right now is how to detect when something has cut through a ship and sliced it into pieces. 
 I'm sure there are algorithms that can handle this, just need to find them.
 As a ships floor gets hit with some damaging effect, it will create new points in its collider holding the damage that push the outer edge of the collider inward.
 I need to find how to detect when that edge gets too close to another edge, causing the ship to split.
 This will make it sooo much easier to track pressure and structural integrity.
 Shouldn't be a problem.
 
 I'll be tracking the damage, collider points, and whatnot in an array and I'll be sending it to whatever I use for graphics.
 Build the mesh programmatically and determine which image gets displayed based on the damage of the points provided.

Right, that was easy: http://geomalgorithms.com/a07-_distance.html
Should give me exactly what I need.
